JOdin3 Web Browser Based and Offline flashing tool  
This is the official support page for JOdin3, a CASUAL-X project. JOdin3 allows you to flash Odin files on Linux, Mac and Windows. It is powered by CASUAL and @Benjamin Dobell 's Heimdall tool. Using the power of CASUALcore, LibPit and Heimdall, it enables flashing of Odin files in the same manner you'd expect from the offical Samsung Odin tool.

Never download from anywhere except the link above. I won't have the CASUAL name tarnished with malware. Also, verify that your download has the proper signatures with the "jar-signer -verify" command.


Easy flashing  
We expect this to be relatively trouble-free. However, there are some stumbling blocks. First, JOdin3 requires a PIT file, which can be automatically obtained, but it requires a device reboot. Jodin3 will walk you through this process. On windows, drivers should be auto-installed. On Mac, Heimdall will be auto-installed. On debian-based Linux, Heimdall will be automatically installed and you will receive in-app instructions on all platforms.

With that said, 99.9999% of problems should be solvable with the simple troubleshooting guide below
